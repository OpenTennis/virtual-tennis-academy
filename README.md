# Virtual Tennis Academy – Powered by [OffCourt](https://offcourt.app) 🎾

Welcome to the official repository of the **Virtual Tennis Academy**, an open-source project to reinvent how ambitious players train, grow, and prepare off the court.

This project is the backbone of the first **fully virtual tennis academy**, structured around the OffCourt methodology: deliberate, high-performance training that happens before you step on court.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The Virtual Tennis Academy project aims to:
- Open-source the structure and tools of a fully remote tennis academy experience
- Provide mental, physical, and strategic preparation content for junior and adult players
- Integrate intelligent progress tracking and planning systems
- Enable coaches to monitor off-court readiness and mindset
- Serve as a companion layer to real-world academy or tournament training

This is **not** a video course or one-size-fits-all program. It’s a system, designed to grow and adapt which is now open to contributions.

## 🧠 Learn the Philosophy

The Virtual Tennis Academy builds on the core idea outlined in  
👉 [The Untapped Power of Off-Court Training](https://offcourt.app/blog/en/untapped-power-off-court-training)

We believe that the 95% of training that happens off the court is the biggest underutilized lever in modern player development. This project turns that insight into infrastructure.
